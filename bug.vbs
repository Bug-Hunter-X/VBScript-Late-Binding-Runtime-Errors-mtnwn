Late Binding: VBScript's late binding can lead to runtime errors if an object or method doesn't exist.  This is especially problematic when dealing with COM objects or external libraries where versioning might cause unexpected failures.

Example:
```vbscript
Set objExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
' ... later in code ...
  objExcel.Workbooks.Open "my_file.xls"
```
If Excel isn't installed or the version is incompatible, this will fail at runtime.

Early Binding Solution:
```vbscript
Dim objExcel As Object
Set objExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
' Check for errors
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Error: " & Err.Description
  Exit Sub
End If
' ... rest of the code...
```
