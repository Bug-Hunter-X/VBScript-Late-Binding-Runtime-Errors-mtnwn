This repository demonstrates a common VBScript error related to late binding and provides a solution using early binding and error handling. Late binding, while convenient, can lead to runtime failures if the objects or methods you are using are unavailable. The solution showcases how early binding and comprehensive error handling can prevent such issues.  The `bug.vbs` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.vbs` offers a corrected version.
